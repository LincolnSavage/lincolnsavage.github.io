The Australian Virtual Reality Film Festival (AVRFF) is Queensland’s leading festival in virtual reality technology and the only event of its kind in Australia. Selections of short films, music videos and documentaries which integrate the use of virtual reality technology are chosen by an industry curatorial panel to showcase the work of the next generation of filmmakers, allowing artists to present their work in a space that promotes creative development and industry discussion. 

Filmmaking utilising Virtual Reality technology is an undefined and exciting new frontier, as filmmakers are able to go beyond limitations of traditional filmmaking practice, instead testing conventions of scale, colour, movement and most importantly what an audience can experience as ‘real’. 

Our team works to showcase the best of this new art form, in collaboration with Brisbane Powerhouse, Screen Queensland and a number of other partners we have succeeded in showcasing some of the most groundbreaking and largest productions to date as our curatorial panel welcomes submissions from both Australia and around the world. 

AVRFF stands as one of the country’s most advanced and forward thinking arts events, a distinguished example of our ability to identify, exhibit and integrate creative practise with new technology.
