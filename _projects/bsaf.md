The Brisbane Street Art Festival (BSAF) is a city-wide public art festival in its third iteration for 2018. Held across more than twenty-five locations throughout Brisbane and involving over 50 local, interstate and international artists through the course of two weeks and hosting a varied program of art forms and installations. BSAF serves as one of Brisbane’s most public facing arts events geared towards engagement, showcase, collaboration and public space activation. The Brisbane audience are immersed in the local creative industry as artists take to the street with large scale works, building a sense of community and inclusivity.

As an avenue for artistic expression, we aim to create a cross-disciplinary platform that encourages any and all art forms to participate. From live mural art and creative masterclasses to music, theatre and light shows, we ensure that BSAF offers a range of performances and workshops designed to engage the public with the outcomes the world standard local, interstate and international artists have to offer. BSAF is growing rapidly into a leading annual art festival, with our team forging connections with a number of local and state government organisations, commercial enterprises, and academic institutions enabling the program, scope and scale to grow dramatically.
