Scribble Slam is a live art battle that runs at Ric’s Backyard in Fortitude Valley once a month. The first round of Scribble Slam returned at Ric’s hosting the incredible talents of EJ Zyla and Bao Ho from Hong Kong; with MC support, Shani Finch, giving attendees an unmissable blow by blow of street artists in action.

The event showcases two artists battling against each other, working with a 90 minute time limit, and each creating their own artwork on a 2.4m x 2.4m wall. The two artists involved are able to use whichever medium they like to create an artwork. Both artists will be completely unaware of what they will be painting until the countdown timer is started. The element of the ‘unknown’ lends Scribble Slam a sense of intensity and intrigue that draws a diverse crowd of art apprecionados. The event has been running for more than three years, originally hosted by Kerbside until that venue closed down.
