The QUBE Effect is a music industry development project funded by the Brisbane City Council supporting emerging music in the Brisbane city region by giving 24 young Brisbane artists and bands opportunities to gain professional experience in the music industry, forge contacts with influential members of the industry and create content beneficial to their creative careers. To do so, we use our contacts and position in the music industry with innovative use of resources to create an experience that is both engaging and beneficial for the next generation of local emerging musicians.

Artist applicants are assessed by a curatorial panel resulting in a selection of 24 standout acts that are chosen to take part in the project. This includes a live performance opportunity in the Brisbane CBD, a music video produced with cutting edge film technology and the opportunity to perform at the QUBE Effect awards night at the Brisbane Powerhouse at which a number of the acts receive prizes. In the production of this event, we produce the film, audio, lighting and performance with a trusted team of experts who tailor their work to the needs of the acts to ensure that we are giving the artists the best experience possible and high level industry creative outcomes to benefit their creative careers.
